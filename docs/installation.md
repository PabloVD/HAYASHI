# Installation

The code is written in Python3, and makes use of the package for cosmological computations [Colossus](https://bdiemer.bitbucket.io/colossus/), as well as several standard Python libraries(`numpy`,`scipy`,`tqdm`), which are automatically installed when `hayashi` is installed.

For installing the Python package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hayashi/):

`pip install hayashi`
