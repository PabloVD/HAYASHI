# Installation

The code is written in Python3, and makes use of the package for cosmological computations [Colossus](https://bdiemer.bitbucket.io/colossus/), as well as several standard Python libraries(`numpy`,`scipy`,`tqdm`), which are automatically installed when `hayashi` is installed.

For installing the Python package from PyPI:

`pip install hayashi`

The Python client SDK is open source, so you can also download it and build locally.
