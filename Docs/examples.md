# Notebook examples

In order to illustrate the usage of the library, we include several example notebooks:

* `absorbers_example.ipynb`: computes all the relevant outputs for the 21 cm forest, such as the optical depth, the maximum impact parameter and the number of absorbers, comparing the cases with and without the subhalo contribution.

* `nlcdm_example.ipynb`: compares the standard CDM 21 cm forest with different non-standard cosmologies: warm dark matter and primordial black holes.

* `density_profiles.ipynb`: compares the 21 cm forest outputs for different density profiles: NFW and uniform.

* `tidal_disruption.ipynb`: compares the 21 cm forest observables when tidal disruption is considered in subhalos.
